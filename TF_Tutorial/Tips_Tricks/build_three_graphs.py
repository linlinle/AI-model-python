'''When building a machine learning Re_classifying in TensorFlow, it's often best to build three separate graphs:
                  The Training graph, The Eval graph,The Inference graph

  The primary source of complexity becomes how to share Variables across the three graphs in a single machine setting.
This is solved by using a separate session for each graph. The training session periodically saves checkpoints,
and the eval session and the infer session restore parameters from checkpoints. The example below shows the main
differences between the two approaches.

  Notice how the latter approach is "ready" to be converted to a distributed version.

  One other difference in the new approach is that instead of using feed_dicts to feed data at each session.
run call (and thereby performing our own batching, bucketing, and manipulating of data), we use stateful iterator objects.
These iterators make the input pipeline much easier in both the single-machine and distributed setting.
We will cover the new input data pipeline (as introduced in TensorFlow 1.2) in the Data_Input_Pipeline.py.
